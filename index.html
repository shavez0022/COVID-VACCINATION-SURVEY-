        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease
        has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.

        Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing
        difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to
        the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Older
        people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects
        (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are
        underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
